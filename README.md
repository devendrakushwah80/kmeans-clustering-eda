# K-Means Clustering with EDA

This project demonstrates **K-Means clustering** applied to a structured dataset along with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The goal is to identify meaningful patterns and group similar data points using unsupervised learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Clustering is an **unsupervised machine learning technique** used to group similar observations.  
In this project, we:
- Analyze the dataset using EDA
- Preprocess features
- Apply K-Means clustering
- Interpret and visualize clusters

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains user-related features such as:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| User ID | Unique identifier |
| Instagram Visit Score | User engagement metric |
| Spending Rank (0–100) | Spending behavior score |

*(Dataset used for academic & learning purposes)*

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA steps include:
- Shape and structure inspection
- Summary statistics
- Missing value check
- Feature distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis

## ⚙️ Model Used

### 🔹 K-Means Clustering
- Algorithm: K-Means
- Type: Unsupervised Learning
- Distance Metric: Euclidean
- Optimal K selection using:
  - Elbow Method

---

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Users are grouped into distinct clusters based on behavior
- Each cluster represents a different engagement/spending pattern
- Visualizations help in understanding cluster separation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
